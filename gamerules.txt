# Game Rules

- Game is played on a 5 cell line
- Players start at either end of the line
- Players select two cards to play each turn, one after the other.  Cards are not revealed until resolved.
- P1 and P2's first cards are resolved in the first half of the turn, then P2 and P1's second cards are resolved in the second half of the turn.
- The second card used is locked out for the next turn.
- If a special card is used, it is removed for the rest of the game.
- Players are in heaven or earth stance at any given time, and they start in heaven stance
- Players cannot move past each other, but can move into the same cell - further movement is ignored.
- Players cannot move off the end of the board - further movement is ignored.
- Movement is always resolved before attacks within each turn-half.
- Movement in heaven stance has priority over movement in earth stance.
- If two players in the same stance move towards each other and would move past each other, they instead end up in the same cell roughly in the middle - favouring the cell closer to the middle if the distance between players is even.
- Attacks target one or more specific cells in relation to the player, e.g. 2 cells forward, 1 cell forward, or same cell.
- If two attacks succeed in the same turn-half, nobody takes damage
- If a player uses counterattack and the other player uses an attack that would hit the enemy, the attacking player instead takes damage.
- Players receive four standard cards at the start of the game.
- Some cards have alternate actions, these must be chosen when the card is played.
- Both players receive one of three special cards at the start, which is not shown to the other player
- Special cards are removed from the game once used
- Players have two hitpoints, and lose one if they are hit by an attack without counterattacking.
- Players lose if they have no hitpoints left
- If a player changes stance in the first half of the turn, the second half of the turn is resolved with the new stance
- Some cards require being in a specific stance to be available as a valid choice.
- "Ahead" means right for p1 and left for p2
